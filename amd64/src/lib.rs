//! Intel x86 and AMD64 disassembler.
//!
//! This disassembler handles the Intel x86 instruction set from the 16-bit 8086 over 32-bit x86 to
//! 64-bit AMD64 instructions, including MMX, SSE1-4, AVX, x87 and miscellaneous instruction set
//! extensions.
//!
//! Decoding instructions is done my a hierarchy of tables defined in `tables.rs`. For each
//! mnemonic a function is defined in `semantic.rs` that emits RREIL code implementing it.
//!
//! Instruction decoding is done in `read`. It expects a 15 bytes of code and will decode
//! instruction prefixes, opcode (including escapes) and opcode arguments encoded in the MODR/M
//! byte and/or immediates.
//!
//! All functions in `semantic.rs` follow the same structure. They get the decoded opcode arguments
//! as input and return a vector of RREIL statements and a `JumpSpec` instance that tells the
//! disassembler where to continue.
